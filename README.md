In this example notebook we demonstrate the basics of `jelli` on a small subset of the future `smelli 3.0` dataset.

To install `jelli`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install jelli
```

This will automatically install the required dependencies, including `rgevolve` - a new package providing RG evolution matrices in various EFTs and bases.

For plotting purposes, we will also use `matplotlib` and `flavio.plots`, so please install them as well:

```bash
pip install matplotlib flavio
```
